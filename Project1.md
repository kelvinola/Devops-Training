This project is to illustrate the implementation of LAMP stack technology which is the combination of the linux operating system, the apache webserver, mysql for the database to store our information and the langauage PHP. The combination of all these technology help to develop a software product. 

For this project, we need to have an aws account for our cloud infrastructure and from there we can use various kinds of linux operating systems that aws provides for use. A very good understanding of the linux command is highly needed for this project to be able to navigate through the terminal while configuring our webservers and databases.

First thing first is to log in to your aws account with the valid credentials then spin up an EC2 instance which is our virtual server or machine.

After clicking "launch an instance" give the instance a name and then select the kind of operating system that you want and in this case we would be using the ubuntu linux distro

create a keypair and for this instance for security reasons and download it to your computer. Create a security group for the firewall, allow ssh traffic from anywhere; make sure the number of instance is 1 and now you can finally launch the instance.

now it is time to connect to our instance on our local machine or terminal

we can easily achieve that by selecting the instance that we launched and click the connect button whic will lead us to this page

copy what is under the example and save it somewhere so that you can paste it on to your local machine.

on your local machine, change your directory into the download folder where your keypair was downloaded into and paste the instance so that you can connect to your instance from your computer.

now ive been able to connect to my virtual machine that was launch on aws in my personal computer's terminal.

the first thing to do after connecting to the terminal is to update the server using the $ sudo apt update

to avoid confusion, it is a good practice to name your server in order to differentiate the different works that you could be doing

Now it is time to dive into the real work!


STEP 1 INSTALLING APACHE SERVER 

The first thing is install our webserver annd for this project the webserver of choice is apache http server which is a widely used server software. it is a open source software the is available for free, it is fast, reliable and secure. 

Use $ sudo apt install apache2 to install apache 


<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 14 50 25" src="https://github.com/kelvinola/Devops-Training/assets/115745653/2e780689-eaac-4f74-aa37-93abe020a96b">


run sudo systemctl status apache2 to check the status of the webserver that had just been installed. 


<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 14 50 44" src="https://github.com/kelvinola/Devops-Training/assets/115745653/733f63a2-2fd2-4211-b73d-001117411961">

Our server is working fine which is a good sign that everything is going on good so far 

another way of ensuring that our webserver is running, is by copying the public ip of our virtual machine and run it on the internet browser to see if the apache page will come up but before we do that we have to make sure that our http port in our security group opened in order for the webpage to show 


<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 15 30 02" src="https://github.com/kelvinola/Devops-Training/assets/115745653/4f40ab50-31e0-4080-a5f4-f8c83cc81a66">



copy the publiic ip from aws and paste it to your web browser and add :80 behind the ip address and apache default page should come up.

STEP 2 INSTALLING MYSQL 


now that my web server is running , the next thing to do is to install a database management system that will be able to store and manage our data for the website in a relational database. mysql is a very popular database management system which is used within the php envirnoment. 


i installed mysql with $ sudo apt install mysql-server

then run sudo mysql

STEP 3 INSTALLING PHP 

PHP is the component of our setup that will process code to display dynamic content to the end user but in addition for the PHP to work we have to install the php-mysql which is the module that allows php to communicate with mysql based databases. the libapache2-mod-php module will enable apache to handle php files. 

to install php and the module  $ sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql


<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 20 22 49" src="https://github.com/kelvinola/Devops-Training/assets/115745653/740a56da-386e-47b7-82b5-0c46c0b7ac91">


To check what version of php you installed then use the php -v command 


<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 20 26 35" src="https://github.com/kelvinola/Devops-Training/assets/115745653/98c364b2-0630-4bc4-858e-18f1acf3f366">


STEP 4 Creating a virtual host for your website using apache

for this project, we will need to set up a domain called projectlamp. by default apache has one server block enabled but we will ignore that and add our own configurations by creating our own directory and call it projectlamp and change ownership of the directory using the chown command 


<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 21 12 28" src="https://github.com/kelvinola/Devops-Training/assets/115745653/d362ee49-a29c-47a7-aa26-aa514e257871">


Then, create and open a new configuration file in Apacheâ€™s sites-available directory using your preferred command-line editor.
